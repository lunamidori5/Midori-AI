Hey there! I'm Luna Midori, the one who brings Midori AI to life, and I'm also an enthusiastic person who enjoys nurturing safe and inviting online communities.

Before joining Twitch, I spent eight wonderful years on YouTube, constantly refining my skills in content creation and building strong communities. My true passion as a streamer is not driven by numbers or income; instead, it revolves around creating a space where everyone feels comfortable, accepted, and entertained.

Recently, I've shifted my focus from Final Fantasy XIV to Honkai: Star Rail, a game that has completely captured my attention since its release. I'm dedicated to helping others, both inside and outside the game, to make the most of their experiences.

I'm passionate about using AI to empower others! Whether you're interested in setting up AI tools, designing with AI, programming AI applications, or simply exploring the possibilities of AI, I'm here to help. If you're seeking companionship, support, or simply a friend to share your adventures with, please don't hesitate to reach out on discord. I'm always eager to make new connections and share my journey with like-minded individuals.

Thank you for being a part of my incredible journey!
